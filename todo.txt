Todo and Smells
---------------

Unify Panel drawing and printing code. Currently, e.g. the corrected
grid is drawn in the CorrectedPanel and the CorrectedPrinter. The code is
very similar and core elements have to be exactly the same, otherwise
the printed display is different from the display on screen.

Split ReportPanel into three panels: InfosPanel,
ColorListPanel and BeadListPanel. In the main
GUI, stack the three panels vertically.

Persist view settings (which panels are visible, are
colors and/or symbols drawn, ...)

Write a log file during each jbead run. The log file
should be a temporary file that is deleted when jbead
is closed. It should be possible to send the logfile
from within jbead to my server in order to simplify
error handling.

The various mouse event handler have now state checked
in if-else-statements. Better to encapsulate this using
the State pattern.

Handle the scrolled-stuff better, i. e. use physical
versus logical coordinates or something like that.

Use abstracted tool object for the different tools.

Create good documentation on the web.

Create screencasts about jbead and post on the web and on youtube.

Push documents to storage on the web. There is a user id and a
passphrase to be configured and this defines where to store and
what is visible. Also, on the web there is a manage page, where
it is possible to publish patterns. These patterns are then
available for download via the webpage or for querying from the
program. Add metadata to the patterns. The server creates on the
fly a thumbnail, or maybe the uploading program does. The program
can query the personal document or all published ones according
to metadata (tags).

Add a keyboard interface to the program analogously to dbweave
so that it is possible to enter patterns with the keyboard and
do selections and so on.

Move selection with mouse. Modi: move, copy, copy without
background (=color0).

Export as PDF/PNG/JPEG.

Export the circling simulation as an animated GIF or an AVI or 
something.

Allow a single line selection.

Add ctrl+c,x,v for selections. This requires that a current input
point (cursor) is available.

Line drawing: use vertical, horizontal or diagonal lines whichever
is closest to the dragged line. Currently only exact vertical and
horizontal lines are used in all other cases the diagonal is used.
This leads to very short inadvertent diagonal lines.

Also line drawing: offer a mode to draw lines in free angles.

Line drawing: why not provide a line mode that draws corrected
vertical lines. Thus such lines would have a left-tilt in the draft
but would be quite vertical in the corrected and simulated panel.

Line drawing: draw lines in corrected/simulation panels!

Add/remove Beads at the start of the pattern (or at the current 
location if this is implemented). This allows to "rotate" the pattern 
or to add/remove beads in a very fine-grained way. (Currently, only
whole lines can be inserted and only at the start of the pattern.)

Currently, only the ObjectModel supports path methods. But maybe it
would be better if the Node itself supports paths. This would allow
to get a subnode and then handle it as if it were the whole ObjectModel.

Add headers with filename, page number, ... best would be configurable.

I have to think about better, alternative print designs. For example, why
not start the first page with the infos and the color counts. Then, below,
fit full columns of draft, corrected, simulation, but only one color repeat.
Finally, to the right, the bead list, as it currently is. This scheme would
allow to simplify page layout.

  --------------------------------------------
  | infos                | bead list columns |
  |----------------------|                   |
  | color counts         |                   |
  |----------------------|                   |
  |draft | corr | simul  |                   |
  |      |      |        |                   |
  |      |      |        |                   |
  |      |      |        |                   |
  |      |      |        |                   |
  --------------------------------------------

It would be useful if selections could be non-rectangular. Like in gimp,
where it is possible to select all pixels of one color, or where an existing
selection can be extended or reduced. On the other hand, this makes the
usage rather difficult.

Add context menu providing convenient access to mirror, rotate, etc.

Add menu toggle for display/hide of color counts and beads per color count.
This was requested by a user and it adds some flexibility without costing
much.
